##Overview
  
**vxlang** is a anti-tamper project that supports code virtualization, obfuscation, and tampering detection.   
The default version of vxlang is free and will support a service that adds virtual-cores and detections upon user request.  
  
The current feature supports Windows native binary files (EXE/DLL) on x86-64 and will be expanded through updates.

##Software Protector
  
- **Code-Virtualization:**  
```
Clears known code and replaces it with unknown or meaningless code.
``` 
  
- **Compress executable:**
```
Encrypts and hides the source file. Runtime access is required for source verification.
```
  
- **Detection of process access:**  
```
Detects actions such as debugging or process stoppage, or gathering information through handles.
```
  
The first goal is to ensure the stability and activation of all functions.
