This page describes the software protection features of vxlang.  

A software protector is a tool used to protect software from unauthorized access, modification, or reverse engineering. It can prevent software piracy and ensure that only authorized users are able to use the software. The software protector usually achieves this by encrypting the software's code, adding licensing restrictions, or using obfuscation techniques to make it difficult to understand the code. The end goal is to secure the software's intellectual property and ensure that it is used in a way that aligns with the creators' intentions.

- `Anti-Debugging`: Anti-debugging refers to the techniques used to prevent software debugging by unauthorized individuals or entities, such as hackers or reverse engineers. The aim of anti-debugging is to protect the software's intellectual property and prevent unauthorized access to the code.
- `Process pause detection`: Software pausing, also known as software stopping, is a technique used in reverse engineering to analyze the behavior of a software system or component when it is temporarily paused. software pausing can also pose a security risk for the software's creators and users. For example, an attacker could use software pausing to reverse engineer a software system and discover sensitive information or vulnerabilities that could be exploited. 
- `Remove Process Handle`:Process handle information leak refers to the unauthorized access and exposure of information related to a process in an operating system. This can occur when an attacker gains access to a process handle, which is a unique identifier that represents a process in the operating system. The attacker can use the process handle to obtain information about the process, such as its memory, resources, and other sensitive information. This information can then be used to carry out further attacks or to gain access to sensitive data. 
- `Memory tampering detection`: Memory tampering refers to the unauthorized modification of the memory content of a process. Memory tampering can be used for malicious purposes, such as stealing sensitive information, disrupting the normal functioning of a system, or taking control of a process.


**vxlang** aims to protect software from these types of threats and will provide even stronger security through additional research.
