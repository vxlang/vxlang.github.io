- The VxLang Project is a code or binary obfuscation project that prevents attackers from performing reverse engineering actions such as static or dynamic analysis, file tampering, and unauthorized access to memory. 
It consists of a packer/protector, code obfuscation tools, and code virtualization tools. It currently targets Microsoft Windows PE executables (*.exe/*.dll/*.sys and UEFI) on x86-64, with future support for Linux ELF and ARM.
